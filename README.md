AUTO MAPPER NAVIGATOR
"""
The purpose of this project is begin work to eventually create an autonomous navigating robot to map the layout of a building and translate the input data log via 2D digital floor plan to a 3D digital schema representation --Python. 
"""

HARDWARE:
	Raspberry Pi Microcontroller
SENSORS:
	Distance Sensors
		Ultrasonic/IR/LiDAR
	Inertial Measurement Unit
	Wheel encoders
	?Camera for VSLAM
MOTORS:
	DC motors
CHASSIS:
	4 wheels

Milestones:
	1. Navigate obstacles
	2. Collect/ Log obstacle data and positioning
	3. Build 2D map from data log
	4. Translate 2D to 3D
	5. ???

TODO:
	set up repo
	use simulated robot while waiting for phys equip
	buy equipment 
	choose Python paradigm -- OOP
	do and learn

CURRENTLY:
	Creating virtual robot and navigation controlls + simulated environment
	THEN:
		simulating robot to create a map layout of a map that will be used to compare accuracy with actual floor plan
